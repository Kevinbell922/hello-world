# hello-world
Day 1
   My name is Kevin if you couldn't guess that from my username. I'm tired of living paycheck to paycheck, so I'm exploring the world of web development. Today is day 1 <for a second time :-)> I worked on Codecademy's first project and one "optional" CaodCademy Pro project. I look forward to a challenge and even more forward to seeing results; knowledge is everything!
